# Check-NPSPolicyUsage

PowerShell script for auditing **Microsoft NPS (Network Policy Server)** logs to see if a specific RADIUS policy is being hit.  
This is especially useful when cleaning up old policies and you want to be certain before disabling them.

---

## âœ¨ Features

- Searches both **System** and **Security** event logs for policy hits
- Filters results by **minutes**, **hours**, or **days**
- Shows either **all hits** or just the **most recent** with `-LatestOnly`
- Extracts **username** and **client IP/host** (when available)
- Handles empty logs gracefully (no ugly errors if no matches are found)

---

## ðŸ›  Requirements

- Windows Server with **NPS installed** and auditing enabled  
- **Administrator PowerShell session** (needed to read the Security log)  
- PowerShell **5.1 or later** (works on PowerShell 7+ too)  

---

## ðŸ“¥ Installation

Clone this repository or download the script file:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/<yourusername>/Check-NPSPolicyUsage.git

Optionally, add the folder to your `$env:PATH` so you can run the script from anywhere.

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

- **Security log events** 6272 (*Access granted*) and 6273 (*Access denied*) are where NPS policy matches usually appear.  
- The **System log** may also contain NPS provider events depending on server configuration.  
- If no events are found in the specified time window, the script reports cleanly without errors.  
- Always run the script in an **elevated PowerShell session** to ensure access to the Security log.
